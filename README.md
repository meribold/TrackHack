# TrackHack

TrackHack is a simple and fast, interactive single-particle tracking program for GNU/Linux
and Windows.  The tracking algorithm is designed for following living cells through
sequences of phase shift images obtained using [digital holographic microscopy][dhm].

The program is written in C++ using some [Boost][] libraries (Filesystem, Regex, Thread)
and [wxWidgets][] for the GUI.
