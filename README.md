TrackHack
=========

Very simple (but fast), semi-automatic single particle tracking software. Designed to track cells in
sequences of phase shift images obtained using digital holographic microscopy. Only grayscale
bitmaps are supported as input.

I didn't work on TrackHack since september 2012. It's written in C++ and I used to build it on MS
Windows with MinGW. It uses some Boost libraries (Filesystem, Regex, Thread) and wxWidgets.
