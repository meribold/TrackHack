TrackHack
=========

Simple and fast semi-automatic single particle tracking software.  Designed to track cells
in sequences of phase shift images obtained using digital holographic microscopy.  Only
grayscale bitmaps are supported as input.

Written in C++ using some Boost libraries (Filesystem, Regex, Thread) and wxWidgets.
Tested on GNU/Linux and Windows (compiled using MSYS2 and MinGW-w64).

Developed at the University of MÃ¼nster.
